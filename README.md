# WeatherEvolve

I sought to build a Real-Time Weather Dashboard using Vue.js.
The goal is to create a dynamic and user-friendly application that allows users to search for weather conditions by city, manage a list of favourite cities, and view detailed weather data, including a 5-day forecast.

 

Core Requirements:

### User Interface:
Display weather data for a searched city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
A 5-day weather forecast for the selected city.
Allow users to save favourite cities and view weather information for those cities.

### State Management:
Use pinia or the Composition API to manage state across the application.
Store the list of favourite cities in local storage.
Error Handling:
Display appropriate error messages for invalid cities or API errors.
### Styling:
Ensure the app is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
### Dark mode support.
Display a graphical representation of temperature trends using a charting library.
Real-time updates every minute.
